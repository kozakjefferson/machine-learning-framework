# machine-learning-framework
Machine learning codes are usually laden with far too many complexities (hyperparameters, preprocessing and right things coded in wrong places ...). I am on a mission to untangle ML code by logically separating work flow and creating a re-usable framework that you can easily apply to your machine learning tasks involving any type of data.


Machine learning code involves phases of operations such as load, pre-process, visualise, train, cross validate and post-process. 
It's these phases that I exploit in creating this framework to reduce the complexity involved in machine learning tasks.
